# Python Basics

Welcome to Python basics! This guide covers important concepts, including comparisons with JavaScript for those familiar with JS, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and Python-specific techniques.

## 1. **Comparing Python with JavaScript**

If you come from a JavaScript background, hereâ€™s a quick comparison with Python:

- **Arrays in JS** = `lists` in Python
  ```js
  // JavaScript
  let arr = [1, 2, 3];
  arr.push(4); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```
  ```python
  # Python
  arr = [1, 2, 3]
  arr.append(4)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

- **Objects in JS** = `dictionaries` in Python
  ```js
  // JavaScript
  let obj = { "key": "value" };
  ```
  ```python
  # Python
  obj = { "key": "value" }
  ```

## 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**

Python is a great language for object-oriented programming (OOP). Here's a breakdown of some important OOP concepts:

### 2.1 **Magic Methods**
Magic methods are special predefined methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores (dunder). They allow customization of behavior for certain built-in operations. These methods are automatically triggered when corresponding actions are performed on objects.

- **`__init__(self)`**:  
  Called when an object is created (constructor).
  
- **`__str__(self)`**:  
  Defines a user-friendly string representation (used by `print()`).

- **`__repr__(self)`**:  
  Defines a developer-friendly string (used in debugging).

- **`__del__(self)`**:  
  Called when an object is about to be destroyed (destructor).

- **`__len__(self)`**:  
  Returns the length of the object (used by `len()`).

- **`__getitem__(self, key)`**:  
  Allows indexing/slicing using `[]`.

- **`__setitem__(self, key, value)`**:  
  Allows setting values using `[]`.

Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"MyClass object with name: {self.name}"

obj = MyClass("Python")
print(obj)  # Output: MyClass object with name: Python
```

### 2.2 **Method Declaration Techniques**
- **Normal Method**: Used for regular method declarations.
  ```python
  def execute_task(self):
      pass
  ```
- **Single Underscore (`_method`)**: Protected method (informative, still accessible).
  ```python
  def _execute_task(self):
      pass
  ```
- **Double Underscore (`__method`)**: Private method (raises `AttributeError` if accessed from outside).
  ```python
  def __execute_task(self):
      pass
  ```

### 2.3 **Commenting Techniques**
- **Single Line Comment**:
  ```python
  # This is a single-line comment
  ```
- **Multi-line Comment**:
  ```python
  '''This is a multi-line comment'''
  ```
- **Docstring for Documentation** (recommended):
  ```python
  """This is a documentation string, used for providing details about the code."""
  ```

## 3. **Advanced OOP Concepts**

### 3.1 **Abstract Methods**
An abstract method is declared in the parent class but not defined. The child class must define this method.

Example:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Parent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def task(self):
        pass

class Child(Parent):
    def task(self):
        print("Task executed")

obj = Child()
obj.task()  # Output: Task executed
```

### 3.2 **Static Methods**
A `@staticmethod` can be called without initializing the class. Useful for utility methods.

Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def log():
        print("Logging some information...")

MyClass.log()  # Output: Logging some information...
```

### 3.3 **Super Keyword**
`super()` allows calling methods from a parent class within the child class.

Example:
```python
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("Method from Parent class")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print("Method from Child class")
        super().show()  # Calls Parent's show method

child = Child()
child.show()  
# Output:
# Method from Child class
# Method from Parent class
```

### 3.4 **Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO)**
Python supports multiple inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from more than one parent class. In case of conflicts, Python uses **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to decide which method to call first.

Example:
```python
class A:
    def show(self):
        print("Method from class A")

class B:
    def show(self):
        print("Method from class B")

class C(A, B):
    def show(self):
        print("Method from class C")
        super().show()

c = C()
c.show()
# Output:
# Method from class C
# Method from class A
```
You can check the MRO using:
```python
print(C.__mro__)  
# Output: (<class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class 'object'>)
```

## 4. **Some more information**

- **```__pycache__``` Directory:**
  The __pycache__ directory is automatically generated by Python to store compiled bytecode files (.pyc) for faster execution. These files are environment-specific and can be regenerated during runtime, so they are not needed in version control.
